## React Native FlatList Rendering Issue

This repository demonstrates a common bug encountered when using the FlatList component in React Native: the list fails to render items even with populated data. The issue is specifically related to the interaction between the `useEffect` hook, the `useState` hook for managing data, and the FlatList's rendering mechanism.

### Bug Description

The provided `bug.js` file contains a simple FlatList implementation.  Despite the `DATA` array containing items, and the `keyExtractor` being properly defined, the FlatList remains empty. This is a subtle bug that can be difficult to diagnose without careful examination of the component's lifecycle and data flow.

### Solution

The solution, found in `bugSolution.js`, addresses this issue by ensuring the `setData` function is called only after the component has mounted, preventing potential issues with race conditions and timing conflicts. The solution showcases a correct implementation of the FlatList with the necessary data handling mechanisms.
